# Dockerized FastAPI Development Environment

A streamlined Dockerized environment for developing and running FastAPI applications with ease.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd docker-dev-env
    ```

2. **Build and Start the Docker Containers**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. **Access the Application**:

    Your FastAPI application should now be running and accessible at: [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80).

### 🎯 Usage

- **Running Commands Inside the Container**:

    To execute commands within the Docker container, use:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web bash
    ```

- **Stopping the Docker Containers**:

    To stop and remove the Docker containers, run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
